Relational databases have become one of the most
 important software components in the world,
 ubiquitous in computing systems from smartphones to data centers.
Nevertheless, traditional relational databases are struggling 
 to meet the demands of modern data analytics,
 which involve more and more complex computation 
 over an increasing variety of data.
In this dissertation, we reinvigorate relational data processing 
 with a new language foundation for writing relational programs,
 a new algorithm for the relational join,
 and techniques to optimize relational queries.
We extend the reach of the relational paradigm in 
 both expressiveness and efficiency, 
 ushering a new era of relational programming.
