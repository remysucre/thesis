%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER

%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

  abstract  = {There is great interest in exploiting the opportunity provided by cloud computing platforms for large-scale analytics. Among these platforms, Apache Spark is growing in popularity for machine learning and graph analytics. Developing efficient complex analytics in Spark requires deep understanding of both the algorithm at hand and the Spark API or subsystem APIs (e.g., Spark SQL, GraphX). Our BigDatalog system addresses the problem by providing concise declarative specification of complex queries amenable to efficient evaluation. Towards this goal, we propose compilation and optimization techniques that tackle the important problem of efficiently supporting recursion in Spark. We perform an experimental comparison with other state-of-the-art large-scale Datalog systems and verify the efficacy of our techniques and effectiveness of Spark in supporting Datalog-based analytics.},

  abstract   = {We present a new approach for data analytics with iterations. Users express their analysis in Datalog with bag-monotonic aggregate operators, which enables the expression of computations from a broad variety of application domains. Queries are translated into query plans that can execute in shared-nothing engines, are incremental, and support a variety of iterative models (synchronous, asynchronous, different processing priorities) and failure-handling techniques. The plans require only small extensions to an existing shared-nothing engine, making the approach easily implementable. We implement the approach in the Myria big-data management system and use our implementation to empirically study the performance characteristics of different combinations of iterative models, failure handling methods, and applications. Our evaluation uses workloads from a variety of application domains. We find that no single method outperforms others but rather that application properties must drive the selection of the iterative query execution model.},

  abstract  = {This is the companion paper of a talk in the Gems of PODS series, that reviews the development, starting at PODS 1988, of a family of Datalog-like languages with procedural, forward chaining semantics, providing an alternative to the classical declarative, model-theoretic semantics. These languages also provide a unified formalism that can express important classes of queries including fixpoint, while, and all computable queries. They can also incorporate in a natural fashion updates and nondeterminism. Datalog variants with forward chaining semantics have been adopted in a variety of settings, including active databases, production systems, distributed data exchange, and data-driven reactive systems.},
